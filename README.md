# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of **multiple supervised machine learning classification algorithms** on the classic **Iris dataset**.  
It is designed for **beginners and job interview preparation**, helping understand how different classifiers perform on the same dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict categorical labels based on input features.  
In this project, we classify iris flowers into three species:

- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

using sepal and petal measurements.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian)  

Each model is trained and evaluated on the same dataset for fair comparison.
